### Repo for General Assembly Data Science project
**What is the question you hope to answer?** Can we predict return on ad spend (ROAS) based on advertiser, promoted product, and ad platform attributes?<br>
<br>
**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**<br>
* Amazon ad platform data: campaign daily spend, sources where we run the product, cost per impression<br>
* Amazon product details: price, rating, number of customer reviews, ranking<br>
<br>

**What do you know about the data so far?** ROAS is typically positively correlated with the product/brand's popularity and with the campaign's ad spend.<br>
<br>
**Why did you choose this topic?** It's a question I've always wondered at work but I never had the bandwidth or skills to set about answering. Building a predictive model will be useful when we run ad campaigns and also for understanding how the entire ad platform works.
