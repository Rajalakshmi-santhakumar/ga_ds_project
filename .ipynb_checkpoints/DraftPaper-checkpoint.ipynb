    "However, I had trouble getting ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) data because in our data warehouse, we store one ASIN per row per campaign which would duplicate each campaign row as many as 100 times. I tried to convert the rows to an array in a single column using Redshift's LISTAGG function but ran into the issue of having too many characters (aka rows) to convert to an array. I then decided to limit the number of ASINs per campaign to five, which would allow me to get a sample of the products without the techinical difficulties of pulling the data. I used the row_number window function to filter out excess ASINs. This will be a known limitation in the model if it is determined that ASINs play a large role in predicting ROAS.\n",

I considered using Amazon's Product API to get the data, but I needed to sign up as an associate and have a website. Therefore I built a webscraper to pull attributes off Amazon's website based on the ASIN. Code below. "
